        "description": "In addition to quite exceptional archaeological wealth, Athens is also a modern city. Proud of their beauty and a lifestyle protected, amongst other factors, by distance, the Greek islands each have their own personality. Crossing the Aegean sea, the film takes the viewer deep inside a lifestyle of exceptional quality. Brushing aside the clichés, Pierre Brouwers and his superb camerawork give a wonderful insight into eternal Greece, a fascinating backdrop to the country’s evolution into the modern era. ",
